Some words.....

Hello friends this kishan here this is my first computer game and also my first C-Language Project .
This is a simple game like other games like flappy bird etc.This game is designe on text based screen using ANSI Standerd conding of "C-11".

Since this game runs  on a text based screen so it blinks a lot.But there are infinit possibilities of improvement of anything.
For that i have made it open source so you can get inspired from my codes or you can also edit them tomake a better one.

"There is no need to learn many languages , just stick to one language and do work many project with that language."

If still you have some question about this questions about this project fill free to ask me.
At last i wanna thanks to my parents for there constant support and 
my mentors Prof. Dr.V.R.Raghveer(Principal IIST Indore),Mrs.Megha Birthare and Mr.Himanshu Ramchandani(CEO Hemans AI) for their valuable guidance.
